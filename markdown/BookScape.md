# BookScape

BookScape is a customizable web platform where users can create personalized reading profiles to showcase books they have read. Users can build a visually customized profile page, display their book collection, and add personal quotes or text sections to express their reading interests.

The application allows deep customization of profile layout and styling while integrating external book data from the Open Library API.

The project is deployed using **Vercel** with **PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres)** as the database.

# Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following core tables.

---

## users

Stores account information.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  private BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  book_order_json JSONB DEFAULT '[]'
);
```

---

## user_books

Stores books added to user profiles.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_books (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  isbn TEXT,
  cover_id TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  author TEXT,
  CONSTRAINT fk_user
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
    REFERENCES users(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT unique_user_book
    UNIQUE (user_id, isbn)
);
```

---

## user_settings

Stores all customizable profile settings.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_settings (
  user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  settings JSONB,
  CONSTRAINT fk_user
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
    REFERENCES users(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Using **JSONB** allows flexible storage of dynamic UI configuration and user-generated content.
